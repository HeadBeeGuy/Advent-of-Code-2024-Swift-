# Advent of Code 2024 (Swift)

This year, I'm going to try doing Advent of Code in Swift. My day job is mostly in Ruby, but being generally fond of Apple platforms, I want to practice Swift more. I've used it off and on over the last several years with sample iOS/macOS projects and I like the language, but I often don't get very deep into it. Maybe my projects will get further off the ground as I gain a deeper familiarity with the language.

We'll see how far I get this year!
